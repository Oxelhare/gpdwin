## How to run Fallout 3 on the GPD Win

First, install [Games For Windows Live](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201134)
Then, copy [d3dl.dll](https://github.com/Oxelhare/gpdwin/raw/master/d3d9.dll) into your Fallout 3 folder.

Check out the video that explains how:

After doing a fresh Steam install, you have two options:

* Play the Steam version on 800x600 windowed mode and use [Borderless Gaming](https://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases)
* Install [Open Morrowind](https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw/releases) and run it in 1280x720

Open Morrowind adds support for the Xbox 360 controller, but I found a custom control set using a controller mapping tool much more convenient.
My favorite controller mapping utility is [AntiMicro version 2.21](https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro/releases).

If you want, get my AntiMicro controller mapping file for Morrowind from [my list](https://github.com/Oxelhare/gpdwin/AntiMicroControllerMappings).
